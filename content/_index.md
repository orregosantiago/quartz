This blog is a personal, speculative, and experimental project based on a strong interest in decomposing the life happening outside. I talk about urban places, ethnographic artifacts, multispecies ethnography, and multimodal research. It works as a knowledge vault and (in the short future) as a regular journal.

## 🕹️How to use this 
This is not a traditional website, at least not right now. It is the unstable *frontend* of an Obsidian-based experiment that compiles markdowns, annotations, drafts, and *media-res* documents. The primary site’s navigation system is composed of a bunch of backlinks, an interactive graph (boot at the footer of the web), and the content area on this main page consisting of the *Knowledge Vault* and *Personal Work*.            

You can navigate through each topic by clicking on its name or following the tag structure if available.
