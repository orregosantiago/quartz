## Extracted Annotations (2022-01-13)
> "Western philosophical traditions from Descartes on have been haunted by an intellectualist thesis which centers the unique capacities of the human in an interior mental life. This particular feature of the human separates it in kind (rather than degree) from non-human, purely mechanistic lifeforms" 

> "the intellectualist thesis is supported by two foundational assumptions: first, that humans can be defined in virtue of their minds, and second, that having a mind separates humans from non-human animals."

> "there is nevertheless a tendency in phenomenology to remain fully within a human-centric research paradigm. Phenomenological research seems to suggest that animals do not have a world, or if they do, it is deficient" 

> "Jokob von Uexküll (2010) and Vilém Flusser and Louis Bec (2012) offer provocative suggestions for a new, speculative biology, but their methods remain largely imaginative— indeed Flusser and Bec refer to their work as a "fable" 

*Non researchers also do the same. My work with dog owners shows how people often expand their ontological status turning into a new being, a dog-person, an hybrid that thinks like human but feels like dog.*

> "Researchers such as Foster begin with the recognition that to understand what it is like to be a non-human animal, the human body itself must be transformed." 

> "They explore their curiosity by attempting to "be" a non-human animal—to inhabit the world of the non-human other by augmenting their own bodies, habits, and ways of being in the world." 

> "Foster performs the human body differently, and in the process, touches upon a non-human excess that is not reducible to mere anthropocentric projection." 

> "To press the phenomenological tradition beyond its humanist roots, one must commit a radical reorganization of the body and of sensation, and the best way to accomplish this is through the esthetic reinvention of one's own bodily apparatus."

> "Uexküll argued that animals are indeed subjects who actively participate in particular Umwelten (environments) or perceptual worlds of significance. The human Umwelt is therefore not exceptional, it is just one more perceptual bubble among many." 

> "As Uexküll (2010) summarizes, "environments themselves represent only subjective realities" (p. 126). For instance, there is no stable environment that has objective spatial and temporal properties. Uexküll argues that there are only functional systems integrating subjects and objects. This means that space and time are relative features of the coordinated perceptions and effectual possibilities of organisms within their environments."

> "Uexküll thus highlights how animals simultaneously exist within effect spaces, tactile spaces, and visual spaces as well as unique temporalities that are attuned to their environmental stimuli to achieve a functional feedback loop. For instance, although a snail appears to move slowly for a human observer, within the spatio-temporality of its unique Umwelt, the snail has the same sense of motion occurring that we do—like the movement of the earth or the flicker of a screen, anything which moves too fast or too slow does not appear to move at all." 

> "Uexküll notes how the same object in different Umwelten will take on radically different perceptual "tones" (p. 129). A logger might see an oak tree as "needing to be cut down," whereas a young child might perceive an ominous face in its bark, conveying a sense of danger. To introduce a non-human perspective, Uexküll cites the example of a fox living in a hollow at the base of the old oak" 

> "Uexküll argues, "In accordance with the different effect tones, the perception images of the numerous inhabitants of the oak are configured differently" (p. 130). No single animal completely perceives the tree or the others' perspectives on the tree, although all of the perceptions form a shared Umwelt." 

> "speculative biology always runs the risk of reifying the Umwelten of non-human animals." 

> "Uexküll himself laments, "The environments (Umwelten) . . . are revealed only to our mind's eye and not to our body's" (p. 42)." 

> "Absent here is the possibility that one might experience new tones beyond the speculative imagination through a more embodied form of phenomenological entanglement."

> "One possible extension of Uexküll's imaginative approach is through fabulation." 

*To turn into an hybrid allows that new element to perceive its environment with a broad perspective since it adds new connections, different “perceptual tones” to the comprehension of reality, adding, or being aware of how an element is composed of different ontological layers. And how through the mixture of selves one can access to more of them.*

*That could be changed through ethnographic practice*

> "For Uexküll and Flusser and Bec, worldhood is distributed across species. Although these worlds differ dramatically, their worldhood enables the possibility for crossovers"

> "Despret argues that there is a long line of performative exchanges between species."

> "This most ancient form of inter-species transmission speaks to that which is not reducible to a world, but rather to an interspecies intelligence that entangles worlds. This cross pollination of worlds is a kind of intercapture, which, for Despret (2016), happens in places at the heart of which new Umwelten are created and overlapped. They are places that make perceptible the porosity of worlds and the flexibility of those who people them. To make two worlds live together in an intelligent way not only means thinking and connecting with what is required in this cohabitation but just as much in taking an interest in what it invents and metamorphoses into. (pp. 166-167)" 

> "Despret, overemphasis on differences between worlds misses (a) how humans and non-human animals share overlapping forms of intelligence and (b) how new worlds can be created through entanglements." 

> "Although differing in the details, we can make some general claims about the posthuman phenomenologies outlined above. First, they all take an esthetic turn to speculate about the nature of non-human animal experience. Metaphors, fables, and finally mimetic performance are utilized to move beyond third person, detached, objective scientific views." 

> "Second, although some might emphasize this more than others, there is some notion that we must move out into the field to interact with animals if we are to understand their ways of being" 

> "This is an informed, patient, and humble approach which is not about colonizing the other so much as exposing the humancentered self to a process of de-centering."

> "He never succeeded in becoming an animal, rather he touched the limit of the human, and by touching that limit, revealed an excess that is not reducible to humancentric ways of being or thinking." 

*In the hybrid i am thinking, humans speak for the dog, with the dog, about the dog. Those are different positions. One is representing the dog, talking in behalf of the dog. With the dog, and about the dog. Those are not in,t speculations, but also observations, cooperative process.*
